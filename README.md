# A Pygame-start-menu-example-with-debug-
# Just a menu I did to teach myself some concepts

I started learning python a month ago and this is a slightly updates but mostly intact code I had a bit ago for practice.

All attributes for everything I did not create myself are in the credits file.

Even to me this is all ugly now but I figure it may help someone some where.

Also if this was all done in Python 3.8 and Pygame 2.0
